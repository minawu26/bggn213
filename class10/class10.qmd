# What is in the PDB? 

Download a CSV file with current composiiton data from: https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
pdbstats
```



```{r}

#x<- "2,2222"

#sub <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
#sub

```

Create a function to remove commas. 
```{r}
commasum<- function (x){
  #Remove comma, convert to numeric and sum
 sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}
```

```{r}
commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```



I can now 'apply()` this function to my wee table to get all the numbers I need. 

```{r}
round(apply(pdbstats,2, commasum)/commasum(pdbstats$Total)*100,2)
```
> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

84.54% for xray and 8.72% for EM. 


```{r}
commasum(pdbstats$Total[1])/commasum(pdbstats$Total)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

0.8665362


 > Q3 class: How does the total number of protein structures in the PDB relate to the total number of protein sequences in Uniprot? 

(186898/250,322,721)*100 = 0.074%



> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There ar 4,410 structures. 

# Visualizing the HIV-1 potease struture 

We will use the Mol* (mol-star) homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/

Looking at 1HSG

Looking at the aspartic acid at position 25 for both the A and B chain. It's represented as space-fill.

## Working with structures in R 

We will use the bio3d package for structrual bioinformatics 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv<- read.pdb("1hsg")

hiv
```

```{r}
head (hiv$atom)
```
```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)

```
```{r}
aa123(pdbseq(hiv)[25])
```

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

NOrmal mode analysis (NMA) a bioinformatics method to predict fucntional motions and large-scale structure changes. 
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Make a wee move (a.k.a "trajectory") of this predicted motions
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_movie.pdb")
```

## Quick comparactive Structure analysis of Adenylate kinase

Extract sequence and run a BLAST search
```{r}
s<- pdbseq(adk)
blast<- blast.pdb(s)
hits<- plot(blast)
```


Get the results from BLAST and download all the top hits. 

```{r}

hits$pdb.id
```


```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

# PCA of all these ADK structures

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
```{r}
 mktrj(pc.xray, file="pco_movie.pdb")

```
